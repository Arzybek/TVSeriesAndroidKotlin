# TVSeriesAndroidKotlin
* The idea: a catalog of various series, in which you can add series to your profile lists: "watching", "watched", "abandoned", "favorites" (and etc.), mark the episodes on which you stopped, rate the series and etc.
* This repository: frontend of the project, an Android/Kotlin application (for a course "Kotlin")
* Backend: Java/Spring application (for a course "Industrial Java Development" by Naumen), located here: https://github.com/Arzybek/TVSeriesProject
